I am discovering rust language.
Commiting daily exercises.


    Type system - static, nominal, linear, algebraic, locally inferred
    Memory safety -  no null or dangling pointers, no buffer overflows
    Concurrency - lightweight tasks with message passing, no shared memory
    Generics    - type parametrization with type classes
    Exception handling -  unrecoverable unwinding with task isolation
    Memory model   -  optional task-local GC, safe pointer types with region analysis
    Compilation model -  ahead-of-time, C/C++ compatible
